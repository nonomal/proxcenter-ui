/**
 * Defense-in-depth scope injection for orchestrator alert rules.
 *
 * The Go orchestrator is not tenant-aware: rules fire on every event
 * matching the rule's filters. To stop a vDC tenant's rule from
 * triggering on a neighbour tenant's VMs we pin `node_pattern` to the
 * vDC's allowed nodes before forwarding the body to the orchestrator.
 *
 * **Limited in typical MSP deployments**: when several vDCs share the
 * same cluster nodes (the common layout), every vDC has every node in
 * its scope and the injected pattern matches all cluster events — same
 * as no pattern. The real isolation in that layout is by PVE pool,
 * which the orchestrator's rule schema doesn't support. Final
 * cross-tenant safety lives in the visibility filter
 * (`@/lib/alerts/visibility.ts`), which checks pool membership per alert.
 *
 * Provider (default) tenants are left alone — they intentionally see
 * everything and the rule form lets them set node_pattern explicitly.
 */
